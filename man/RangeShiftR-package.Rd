\title{RangeShiftR: An R package for individual-based simulation of spatial eco-evolutionary dynamics and species' responses to environmental changes}
\description{
RangeShiftR provides individual-based simulations of spatial eco-evolutionary dynamics. It is based on the C++ software RangeShifter, making it flexible and fast. RangeShiftR models the processes of demography, dispersal and evolution in an inter-dependent way, offering substantial complexity in the corresponding modelling choices. It is entirely open-source and aims to facilitate the application of individual-based and mechanistic modelling to eco-evolutionary questions.

\code{RangeShiftR} provides flexible and fast simulations of spatial eco-evolutionary dynamics.
It implements the individual-based simulation software \emph{RangeShifter},
\insertCite{bocedi2014,bocedi2020}{RangeShiftR},
making it available for all machines that can build and run \emph{R}.

\code{RangeShiftR} models the processes of demography, dispersal and evolution in an
