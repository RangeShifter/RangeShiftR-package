\description{
Emigration - the first phase of dispersal - is modelled as the probability that an individual leaves its natal patch during the present year (or season).
It is constant by default, but can be set to be density-dependent (\code{DensDep}) and/or to vary for each individual (\code{IndVar}). In case of a stage-structured/sexual
population model, the emigration probabilities can also vary with stage/sex (\code{StageDep/SexDep}). If inter-individual variability is
enabled, the emigration traits can also be allowed to evolve (also set \code{TraitScaleFactor}).
}
\details{
Emigration is modelled as the probability \eqn{d} that an individual leaves its natal patch during the present year or season (every reproductive event
is always followed by dispersal).
Populations with non-overlapping generations have only a single opportunity to emigrate, whereas in a stage-structured population the realised overall emigration
rate can be larger than \eqn{d}, if a stage with \eqn{d>0} lasts for more than one year so that an individual has multiple opportunities to emigrate (each with probability \eqn{d}).

The emigration probability \eqn{d} can be density-dependent (set \code{DensDep=TRUE}), in which case it is given by the following function, introduced by \insertCite{kun2006evolution;textual}{RangeShiftR}:

\ifelse{html}{\out{&emsp;&emsp; d(i,t) = D<sub>0</sub> / ( 1 + e<sup>-&alpha;sub>E</sub> (N(i,t) / K(i,t) - &beta;sub>E</sub>) </sup> ) } }{\deqn{ d(i,t) = D_0 / ( 1 + exp[-α_E (N(i,t)/K(i,t) - β_E) ] ) } }

In the case of stage-structured models this equation is modified to:

\ifelse{html}{\out{&emsp;&emsp; d(i,t) = D<sub>0</sub> / ( 1 + e<sup>-&alpha;sub>E</sub> (b(i,t) * N(i,t) - &beta;sub>E</sub>) </sup> ) } }{\deqn{ d(i,t) = D_0 / ( 1 + exp[-α_E (b(i,t) N(i,t) - β_E) ] ) } }

In the first case, \eqn{K(i,t)} is the carrying capacity of the cell/patch \eqn{i} at time \eqn{t} given by \code{K_or_DensDep}.
In the latter case, \eqn{b(i,t)} represents the strength of density dependence and is given by the inverse of \code{K_or_DensDep}.\cr
Further, \ifelse{html}{\out{D<sub>0</sub>}}{\eqn{D_0}} is the maximum emigration probability,
\eqn{N(i,t)} is the number of individuals in the cell/patch \eqn{i} at time \eqn{t},
\ifelse{html}{\out{&beta;<sub>E</sub>}}{\eqn{β_S}} is the inflection point of the function and
\ifelse{html}{\out{&alpha;<sub>E</sub>}}{\eqn{α_S}} is the slope at the inflection point.\cr

Various functions have been proposed for density dependent emigration \insertCite{hovestadt2010information,poethke2011ability}{RangeShiftR}.
This one was chosen here because it is a flexible function that
allows for modelling a range of different reaction norms, as well as their emergence through evolution. In the case of density-dependent
emigration, we assume individuals to have full knowledge of the population density and carrying capacity (or 1/b, respectively) in their natal patch.
Information acquisition is not explicitly modelled.

The emigration probability can be allowed to vary between individuals (set \code{IndVar=TRUE}) and to evolve. In the this case, individuals exhibit either one trait
determining the density-independent \eqn{d} (when \code{DensDep=FALSE}), or the three traits \ifelse{html}{\out{D<sub>0</sub>}}{\eqn{D_0}}, \eqn{α} and
\eqn{β} determining the density-dependent emigration probability (when \code{DensDep=TRUE}).\cr
For each trait the initial distribution in the population (as mean and standard variation) must be set in \code{EmigProb} (instead of only one constant value),
as well as their scaling factors in \code{TraitScaleFactor} (see \code{\link[RangeShiftR]{Genetics}}).
Also, if \code{IndVar=TRUE} is set for a stage-structured population, it is required to specify the stage which emigrates via \code{EmigStage}.

It is possible to model sex-specific emigration strategies (set \code{SexDep=TRUE}) \insertCite{greenwood1980mating,lawson2007advances}{RangeShiftR}.
In this case the number of traits is doubled; one set coding for the trait(s) in females and the other for the trait(s) in males.
As well as being sex-biased, emigration parameters can be stage-biased (set \code{StageDep=TRUE}) when modelling stage-structured populations.
However, the current version does not accommodate inter-individual variation in emigration strategies when they are stage-dependent.

The parameters that determine the emigration probabilities have to be provided via \code{EmigProb}, which generally takes a matrix, or - if only a single constant probability is
used (i.e. \code{DensDep, IndVar, StageDep, SexDep = FALSE}) - a single numeric. The format of the matrix is defined as follows: The number of columns depend on the options \code{DensDep} and \code{IndVar}. If \code{DensDep=FALSE}, the
density-independent probability \eqn{d} must be specified. If \code{DensDep=TRUE}, the functional parameters \ifelse{html}{\out{D<sub>0</sub>}}{\eqn{D_0}}, \eqn{α} and \eqn{β} (cp. equation above) must be specified.
Additionally, if \code{IndVar=FALSE}, these parameters are fixed, but if \code{IndVar=TRUE} each of them is replaced by two parameters: their respective mean and
standard deviation. They are used to normally distribute the traits values among the individuals of the initial population.

All parameters have to be given for each stage/sex if the respective dependence is enabled. If \code{StageDep=TRUE}, state the corresponding stage in the first column.
If \code{SexDep=TRUE}, state the corresponding stage in the next (i.e. first/second) column, with \eqn{0} for \emph{female} and \eqn{1} for \emph{male}. The following table lists the required columns and their correct order for different settings:

\tabular{ccccc}{DensDep \tab IndVar \tab StageDep \tab SexDep \tab columns \cr

 }

The column headings need not be included, only the numeric matrix is required. The rows require no particular order, but there must be exactly one row for each stage/sex combination. For example, in the case of density-, stage- and sex-dependent emigration with no individual variability:
\tabular{ccccc}{ \out{&emsp;} 0 \tab \out{&emsp;} 0 \tab \out{&emsp;} 1.0 \tab \out{&emsp;} 20 \tab \out{&emsp;} 0.2 \cr
 \out{&emsp;} 0 \tab \out{&emsp;} 1 \tab \out{&emsp;} 1.0 \tab \out{&emsp;} 20 \tab \out{&emsp;} 0.1 \cr
 \out{&emsp;} 1 \tab \out{&emsp;} 0 \tab \out{&emsp;} 0.7 \tab \out{&emsp;} 25 \tab \out{&emsp;} 0.5 \cr
 \out{&emsp;} 1 \tab \out{&emsp;} 1 \tab \out{&emsp;} 0.8 \tab \out{&emsp;} 50 \tab \out{&emsp;} 0.5 \cr
 \out{&emsp;} 2 \tab \out{&emsp;} 0 \tab \out{&emsp;} 0.4 \tab \out{&emsp;} 10 \tab \out{&emsp;} 1.0 \cr
 \out{&emsp;} 2 \tab \out{&emsp;} 1 \tab \out{&emsp;} 0.5 \tab \out{&emsp;} 20 \tab \out{&emsp;} 1.0
}

In the special case that \code{DensDep=FALSE} and transfer is realised by \code{\link[RangeShiftR]{DispersalKernel}}, then the option \code{UseFullKern} may be switched on. It
will prevent re-sampling from the kernel if the distance sampled does not move the individual out of its natal cell/patch. Such individuals
are treated as philopatric recruits, and hence the kernel determines the probability of emigration. In this case, the emigration probability
for all stages/sexes which potentially disperse should be set to \eqn{1.0}.
